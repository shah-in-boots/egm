  title: Evaluating Cardiac Electrophysiological Signals
  description: >
    A system for importing electrophysiological signal into R, based
    on the Waveform Database(WFDB) software package, written by Moody et al
    2022 <doi:10.13026/gjvw-1m31>. This package provides a wrapper for
    utilizing WFDB functions for reading and writing signal data in R, as well
    as functions for visualization and analysis. This package introduces a
    stable and compatible class for working with signal data, and supports
    reading in of specific, electrophysiogical file formats, including
    intracardiac electrograms.
